		        <li>We know that finding a new normal is hard, and many of you may not be in ideal study situations.  If there are ways we can adapt the way we do lectures, sections, office hours, homeworks, etc. to help, please let us know, and we will try our best! </li>
		  	<li>Please see the zoom tab for links to lecture, section, office hours, and study rooms! </li>

		<p>
			Introduction to machine learning, providing a probabilistic view on artificial intelligence and reasoning
			under uncertainty. Topics include: supervised learning, ensemble methods and boosting, neural networks,
			support vector machines, kernel methods, clustering and unsupervised learning, maximum likelihood,
			graphical models, hidden Markov models, inference methods, and computational learning theory.
		</p>
		<p>
			Students should feel comfortable with multivariate calculus, linear algebra, probability theory,
			and complexity theory. Students will be required to produce non-trivial programs in Python.
